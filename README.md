godellob-prover
===============

Automatic theorem prover for Gödel-Löb system. 

Requires newer C++ compiler (written in C++11 standard).

Unixoids: download as zip, extract, run g++ *.cpp -std=c++11 -o bin 

Windows: same as Unixoids, but might require downloading MinGW first (gcc for Windows) or any other C++11-compliant compiler (MSVC etc.)
